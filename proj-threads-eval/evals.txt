Charlie Shou|97|21|For the design portion of the project, he laid out basic data structures and algorithms for the Efficient Alarm Clock, Strict Priority Scheduler, and User Threads. Further, he worked with Ashley to finish an in-depth design of the rest of the user threads. During the implementation portion, he worked with Ashley on implementing the User Thread. Finally, he also wrote his part on the final report.
Kristie Huang|115|19.5|For the design portion of the project, she worked with me to design the Strict Priority Scheduler portion of the project. Further, she also completed the concept check for the design doc. For the implementation portion, she implemented the Strict Priority Scheduler and debugged it to pass most of the corresponding tests. Finally, she also wrote her part on the final report. Besides the technical work, she is great at explaining her thoughts out loud which made it easy to work with her.
Ashley Ye|51|19.5|For both the design and implementation portions of the project, she worked with Charlie to finish an in-depth design and implementation of the user threads. Further, she wrote a test case for user threads. Finally, she also wrote her part on the final report. Besides the technical work, she communicates well with the team and she also keeps us organized by scheduling meetings.
