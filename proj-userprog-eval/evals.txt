Ashley Ye|51|18|Ashley for the most part worked on Floating Point Operations. She contributed her part to the design doc and final report. She also worked on writing out the test for the final report. Throughout all the meetings she came prepared and kept us organized by scheduling meetings and keeping track of TODOs by the next meeting. It is not because she didn't do enough that I rewarded her fewer points, but Charlie contributed so much that it wouldn't be fair if I didn't reward him more.
Charlie Shou|97|22|Charlie for the most part worked on Argument Passing. After he finished his part, he went on to help out with the rest of the tasks. He contributed his part to the design doc and the final report. He also worked on concept checks and writing tests for the final report. He was probably the one to do the most work out of all of us and deserved all the points he can get. He served as our go-to person whenever we had questions. He seemed to understand most of the codebase. He was available most of the time on messaging platform and was usually the first one to respond to our questions. 
Kristie Huang|115|20|Kristie for the most part worked on Process System Calls. She contributed her part to the design doc and final report. She also helped out with Argument Passing. Throughout the project, she always checked in with the rest of the teammates and made sure each of us made progress. She also constantly asked questions about different parts of the projects helping her understand the rest of the project and also helping us to understand the project deeper by making us think deeper about every line of code we wrote.
